# KaTeX Direction Fixer

A Chrome extension that ensures all KaTeX formulas are displayed left-to-right by adding `dir="ltr"` to every `<span class="katex">` element.

## Purpose

On right-to-left websites (like Hebrew or Arabic), KaTeX formulas may appear misaligned or reversed. This extension forces them to render left-to-right for correct display.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder containing this code.
5. Done! The extension will now work automatically on any page with KaTeX.
